# *About the project:*
This is my portfolio website, created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It can be used from both laptop and mobile.

:speech_balloon: It tells you a little bit about me, about my skills and little by little I'm updating it with new projects.

:envelope: It has a "contact" section where you can send me and email if you have questions or if you're interested in my work.

You can also switch from dark theme to light theme, here's the view in light mode:
